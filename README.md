#  Is the Golden Leaf Still Profitable?  
## Analyzing Zimbabwe's Tobacco Market Trends (2015–2025)

> A Data Science Case Study on the Sustainability and Profitability of Tobacco Farming in the Face of Climate and Economic Pressure

---

##  Introduction

Tobacco is Zimbabwe’s most valuable agricultural export ,contributing significantly to the national GDP and supporting millions of livelihoods. However, over the last decade, the industry has faced serious headwinds:

- **Erratic climate** (droughts, unpredictable rainfall)  
-  **Economic instability** (inflation, currency volatility)  
-  **Volatile pricing and production levels**

This project goes beyond conventional trend analysis by integrating **climate data** (rainfall, droughts) and **economic indicators** (inflation) to uncover the key drivers affecting tobacco market performance in Zimbabwe between **2015 and 2025**.

The goal is to provide **data-driven, actionable insights** for **farmers**, **investors**, and **policymakers** seeking to understand the future of Zimbabwe’s "golden leaf."

##  Objectives

- Analyze **historical tobacco prices** and **sales volumes** (both local and export)
- Identify **seasonal and annual patterns** in market behavior
- Quantify the effect of **climatic variables** (rainfall, drought frequency)
- Assess the influence of **inflation** on profitability
- **Forecast future tobacco prices** under different economic and climatic conditions
- Provide **recommendations** for policy and agricultural strategy

## Research Questions

1.  How have **tobacco prices and sales volumes** changed from 2015 to 2025?  
2.  What **seasonal patterns** emerge in tobacco sales and pricing data?  
3. How do **rainfall and drought events** affect production and market performance?  
4. What is the **relationship between inflation** and tobacco pricing/profitability?  
5.  Can we **forecast future tobacco prices** using weather and economic trends?  
6.  What do these insights mean for **farmer livelihoods** and **market sustainability**?
